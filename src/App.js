              Hello! My name is Aur√®le and I love building things, managing projects and learning new skills. 
              I am a self-taught full-stack web developer looking for his first work experience in this area.
              Before learning to code, I have had more than 3 years experience working in small tech businesses.
              I had the opportunity to manage a company and overseeing the release of 1 website and 2 apps (e-commerce and booking).
              </p>
              {
                !display &&
                <a className="link" onClick={() => setDisplay(!display)}>Show More</a>
              }
              {
                display &&
                <div>
                  <p>
                  I had my first taste of the tech industry when I spent six months as a project manager intern at Ubisoft Shanghai Studio. There I discovered the buzzing world of a game development company and the challenges of project management.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Then, I had the opportunity to work as a business developer at Camboticket, where I was mainly responsible for finding ways to increase sales volume. 
                  This included developing partnerships, improving user experience, and manage SEM/SEO. In this role, I worked closely with developers to improve the website and implement new features. I also had the lead on the new app, working closely with developers to ensure that it was released on time with all needed functionalities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Most recently, I took on the role of general manager at Delishop, where I was responsible for recruiting developers and managing the release of the new website and two apps under tight time and budget constraints. All of these projects were successful and are still live today.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Throughout previous experiences, I have found great pleasure in working in tech environments filled with challenges and innovation. I have always been interested in learning programming in more depth, and recently took the opportunity to do so through Codecademy's Fullstack course, as well as various online resources and books. I have a particular interest in Javascript and React, and enjoy the problem-solving aspect of programming in addition to the opportunity to build something new.
                  </p>
                  <a className="link" onClick={() => setDisplay(!display)}>Show Less</a>
                </div>
              }
              <p>
              Today, I am looking for an opportunity to use my previous experience along with the new skills I learned, working as a developer in dynamic company.
              I hope to keep learning, building and managing several projects with great teams a challenging environment.
              </p>
